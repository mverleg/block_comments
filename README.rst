Block comments (Firefox addon)
---------------------------------------

User content is an indispensable part of the internet. Think of all the awesome Youtube videos. But on some occasions, the content is better without frustrated people with too much time spewing their wordy ignorance all over your screen. Think of Youtube 96.4% of all Youtube comments.
