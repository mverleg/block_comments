Block comments (Firefox addon)
---------------------------------------

User content is an indispensable part of the internet. Think of all the awesome Youtube videos. But on some occasions, the content is better bored people spewing their wordy ignorance all over your screen. Think of 96.4% of all Youtube comments.

This comic describes it well: https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2007-03-14

It can be tempting to read it, and even reply. This addon is here to help you resist that urge, by simply hiding this wordy ignorance.

Included websites

These things are blocked:

* Youtube: comments

which is already enough to save days worth of time, but other suggestions are welcome!
